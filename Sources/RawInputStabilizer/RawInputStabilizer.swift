//  Implementation of the stroke stabilizer from [OpenToonz](https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz)
//  project (SmoothStroke class in toonzrasterbrushtool.cpp), converted to the Swift language for
//  the purpose of the [ArtOverflow](https://artoverflow.io) drawing app for Mac, and with a few changes.

/// This stroke stabilizer provides both a stabilized path and pressure. Other properties could be stabilized if needed by taking them into account
/// in the Smooth() function.
///
/// Changes with respect to the original OpenToonz implementation are as follow:
/// - In generatePoints(), CatmullRom is used to add more points only at the beginning of the stroke, this is to lower
/// computation time when later averaging the whole set of points. Starting from 10K points, smoothing requires too much
/// CPU time for real time output on a i7 8700K, so interpolating only at the stroke ends helps reaching this threshold much later.
/// Additionally the stylus input rate on macOS is quite enough to get smooth results in the middle of the stroke (removing it at the
/// ends give much less nicer thin stroke ends though, so it is kept).
/// - RawInputStabilizer provides an asynchronous API. This helps leveraging multicore power while keeping the main thread
/// free to spend its time on other work: GPU task scheduling in the case of ArtOverflow.
/// - Implementation of the Smooth() function is fixed to properly insert CatmullRom interpolated points at the beginning and end
/// of the generated array of points. Original implementation was inserting the end points around 10 items before the end.
/// - Unit tests are added, although a significant part of the value of this stabilizer is visual appreciation of the output.
///
/// Warning: Do NOT try to run this in debug mode unless you have plenty of time ahead or the dataset is very small.
