# RawInputStabilizer

Implementation of the stroke stabilizer from [OpenToonz](https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz) project (SmoothStroke class in toonzrasterbrushtool.cpp), converted to the Swift language for the purpose of the [ArtOverflow](https://artoverflow.io) drawing app for Mac, and with a few changes. See documentation in RawInputStabilizer.swift for more details.
